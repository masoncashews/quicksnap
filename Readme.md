# QuickSnap
This is a simple windows app to take a quick screenshot of a registered area of screen.

This is great for snapping a screenshot of videos as you watch them.  

Points of interest:
* The file is configurable in parts and will append an autoincrementing value.
* The path is configurable
* To set the region you click into the **Upper Corner** field
* * Put your cursor in the upper right corner of the area you wish to capture and do *CTRL+X*
  * Put your cursor in the lower left corner of the area you wish to capture and do *CTRL+Y*
  * Do *CTRL+S* top populate the **Upper Corner** and **Size** fields

I basically built this when I was watching training videos and needed to capture slides.
